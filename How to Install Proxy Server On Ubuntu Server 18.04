1) apt update

      a.> http_port 3128
       
      You can ignore this section because by default it will detect it automatically
      b.> visible_hostname
  
      Please sign # on your acl remove
      c.> # Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
          # Adapt to list your (internal) IP networks from where browsing
          # should be allowed
          acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8    # RFC1918 possible internal network
          acl localnet src 172.16.0.0/12 # RFC1918 possible internal network
          acl localnet src 192.168.0.0/16        # RFC1918 possible internal network
          acl localnet src fc00::/7       # RFC 4193 local private network range
          acl localnet src fe80::/10      # RFC 4291 link-local (directly plugged) machines
  
      And finally in the http_access section, please add the command line as above
